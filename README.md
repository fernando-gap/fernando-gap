<!-- Summary about me -->
One of the best things that ever happened to my life was to discover programming. Not only changed my life, but changed the way I see things. I am working with web development with a focus on back-end and devops side. Currently interested in many kinds of programming stuff such as automation, operating systems, and mainly in programming language theory.
